# Challenges for beginners

### Beginner challenges

\[TODO: flesh this out\]

1. The spring documentation generally assumes you have knowledge of Java and Java patterns that you are wiring into Spring \(e.g. you are familiar with the Java Persistence Repository interface and what a DAO is\). This is difficult if you are coming from background without those terms or patterns. I have yet to find a holistic guide like [the Ruby on Rails tutorial](https://www.railstutorial.org/) that provides a beginner focused entry into the Rails world.
2. Spring Boot does enable you to start an application very quickly, but I find it to be even less transparent than Rails in terms of how things are configured. To be blunt, the magic of spring's boot's auto configuration provided a far less friendly on-ramp than `rails new`
3. Spring's wide adoption in the enterprise, coupled with the lack of a "Spring way", mean that consistent patterns are difficult to come by
