# Overview

There is a _lot_ of information out there when it comes to spring boot. In fact, the hardest part of learning was not finding documentation, but rather, finding a consistent learning path. Because spring provides so many ways to do things, tutorials will often differ on how things are done. As a beginner, it can be hard to sort out what is simply a matter of preference and what is  a best practice.

My hope for this guide is:

1. Contextualize Spring/Boot for a non Java/Spring engineer \(like myself\)
2. Provide a stable learning path that makes transitioning from a "typical" Ruby on Rails background to Spring/Boot
3. Provide some common gotchas and solutions
